# MNIST Digit Recognition Using CNN

MNIST Digit Recognition can be regarded as a 'Hello World' into Deep Learning based Computer Vision problems.
MNIST dataset consists of images of handwritten digits (from 0 to 9). The objective is to recognize any handwritten digit outside the training data. 
Accuracy is chosen as the performance metric.
I used Keras API for modelling the 5 layered CNN architecture.
